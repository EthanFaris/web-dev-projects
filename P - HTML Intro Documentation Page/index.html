          <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>  
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="what_is_html?">
          <header id="what_is_html" class="topic-header">What is HTML?</header> 
          <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:</p> 
          <div class="code medium">
            <code>My cat is very grumpy</code> 
          </div> 
          <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:</p> 
          <div class="code medium">
            <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
          </div>
          <br> 
          <br> 
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="elements">
          <header id="elements_section" class="topic-header">Elements</header> 
          <p>The main parts of our elements are as follows:</p> 
          <ol class="topics-list">
            <li><span class="bold">The opening tag:</span> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">The closing tag:</span> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">The content:</span> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">The element:</span> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="attributes">
          <header id="attributes_section" class="topic-header">Attributes</header> 
          <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things. Some attributes have no value, such as required.</p> 
          <p>Attributes that set a value always have:</p> 
          <ol class="topics-list">
            <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).</li>
            <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
            <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="nesting_elements">
          <header id="nesting_elements" class="topic-header">Nesting Elements</header> 
          <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a &lt;strong&gt; element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:</p> 
          <code class="code medium">&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</code> 
          <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we opened the <p> element first, then the &lt;strong&gt; element; therefore, we have to close the &lt;strong&gt; element first, then the &lt;p&gt; element. The following is incorrect:</p> 
          <code class="code medium">&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code>  
          <p>The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another. If they overlap as shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess at what you were trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="void_elements">
          <header id="void_elements" class="topic-header">Void Elements</header> 
          <p>Some elements have no content and are called void elements. Take the &lt;img&gt; element that we already have in our HTML page:</p> 
          <code class="code medium">&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" /&gt;</code> 
          <p>This contains two attributes, but there is no closing </img> tag and no inner content. This is because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="document_structure">
          <header id="document_structure" class="topic-header">Document Structure</header> 
          <p>That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the code we put into our index.html example (which we first met in the Dealing with files article):</p> 
          <div class="code large">
            <code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;<br>
  &lt;html lang="en-US"&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&lt;head&gt;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" /&gt;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title>My test page&lt;/title&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&lt;/head&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&lt;body&gt;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" /&gt;<br>
    &nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;<br>
  &lt;/html&gt;
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>Here, we have the following:</p> 
          <ul class="topics-list">
            <li><span class="code small">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</span> — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However, these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.</li>
            <li><span class="code small">&lt;html>&lt;/html&gt;</span> — the &lt;html&gt; element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element. It also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of the document.</li>
            <li><span class="code small">&lt;html>&lt;/html&gt;</span> — the &lt;html&gt; element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element. It also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of the document.</li>
            <li><span class="code small">&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</span>— This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later on.</li>
            <li><span class="code small">&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt;</span> — This viewport element ensures the page renders at the width of viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking them down.</li>
            <li><span class="code small">&lt;title>&lt;/title&gt;</span> — the &lt;title&gt; element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.</li>
            <li><span class="code small">&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</span> — the &lt;body&gt; element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
      
        <section class="main-section" id="images">
          <header id="images_section" class="topic-header">Images</header> 
          <p>Let's turn our attention to the &lt;img&gt; element again:</p> 
          <code class="code medium">&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" /&gt;</code> 
          <p>As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the src (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.</p>
          <p>We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In the alt attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:</p>
          <ol id="topics-list"> 
            <li>They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the alt text to them.</li> 
            <li>Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately changing the path inside your src attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the page, you should see something like this in place of the image:</li> 
          </ol>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="headings">
          <header id="headings_section" class="topic-header">Headings</header> 
          <p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;, although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:</p>
          <div class="code large"> 
            <code>&lt;!-- 4 heading levels: --&gt;<br>
              &lt;h1&gt;My main title&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
              &lt;h2&gt;My top level heading&lt;/h2&gt;<br>
              &lt;h3&gt;My subheading&lt;/h3&gt;<br>
              &lt;h4&gt;My sub-subheading&lt;/h4&gt;</code>
          </div>
          <br>
        </section>
      
        <section class="main-section" id="paragraphs">
          <header id="paragraphs_section" class="topic-header">Paragraphs</header>
          <p>As explained above, &lt;p&gt; elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content:</p>
          <code class="code medium">&lt;p&gt;This is a single paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code> 
          <br>
          <br>
        </section>
      
        <section class="main-section" id="lists">
          <header id="lists_section" class="topic-header">Lists</header> 
          <p>A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:</p>
          <ol class="topics-list"> 
            <li><span class="bold">Unordered lists</span> are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a &lt;ul&gt; element.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Ordered lists</span> are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an &lt;ol&gt; element.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="links">
          <header id="links_section" class="topic-header">Links</header> 
          <p>Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple element — &lt;a&gt; — "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow these steps:</p>  
          <ol class="topics-list">
            <li>Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".</li>
            <li>Wrap the text in an &lt;a&gt; element, as shown below:<br><code class="code medium inlist">&lt;a&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code></li>
            <li>Give the &lt;a&gt; element an href attribute, as shown below:<br><code class="code medium inlist">&lt;a href=""&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code></li>
            <li>Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to point to:<br><code class="code medium inlist">&lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">
  Mozilla Manifesto
&lt;/a&gt;</code></li>
          </ol> 
          <p>You might get unexpected results if you omit the https:// or http:// part, called the protocol, at the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you wanted it to.</p>
